Hello! My name is Lucas Mendicino and I am a recent graduate of Oberlin College with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Statistical Modeling with additional coursework in Psychology and Cognitive Science.

I am the co-investigator to the Psychology department's head, Nancy Darling, and we are looking at improving treatment outcomes for adolescent's with chronic pain. Specifically, we are researching adolescent perception's of the legitimacy of parental and doctor authority over rehab directives.
